# autonomous-research-agent
Developed a LangChain-based autonomous agent for multi-step research. It utilizes advanced planning and tool-use to decompose complex queries, retrieve data, and synthesize reports. The modular design enables iterative strategy refinement and "plug-and-play" integration for new tools, significantly reducing manual research intervention.
